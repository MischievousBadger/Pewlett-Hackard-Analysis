# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Pewlett-Hackard is a large company that is currently looking carefully at its employee base as "baby boomers" get closer to retirement.  To determine how many employees will be nearing retirement age, Human Resources has been pulling together various datasets, both to look at what positions may need filling in the future as well as to know which employees are eligible for their retirement package offerings.  Leadership is also considering adding a mentorship program for employees who are ready to retire; this would allow the experienced retirees to move into part-time roles while mentoring new staff. The purpose of the current analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are currently eligible to participate in a management mentorship program.  

## Results
- A total of 72,458 current employees were identified as being retirement-eligible while analyzing data for birth dates between 1/1/52 and 12/31/55.    
- Seven staff titles were identified among the 72,458 retirement-eligible employees. These employees include 25916 Senior Engineers, 24926 Senior Staff, 9,285 Engineers, 7636 Staff, 3603 Technique Leaders, 1090 Assistant Engineers, and 2 Managers.

- The bulk of upcoming retirements span two titles:  Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions.  These two titles comprise approximately 70% of the retiring positions. 
- A total of 1549 total mentorship-eligible employees were identified by analyzing data for employees with birth dates between 1/1/65 and 12/31/65 (approximately 10-14 years pre-retirement eligibility). 

## Summary
The 'silver tsunami' will likely have a significant impact on Pewlett-Hackard's workforce, as over 72,000 employees will become retirement-eligible over the next few years. Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions will be the hardest hit, and many collective years of expertise and knowledge in these positions will be lost as employees retire. Over the next 4 years, Pewlett-Hackard will need to plan to replace approximately 17,000-19,000 positions as employees become retirement-eligible.  For employees born in 1952, there will be an estimated loss of 16,981 employees.  Employees born in 1953 total 18,328, with a peak of 18,612 employees born in 1954, and slightly fewer employees born in 1955 at 18,537.
