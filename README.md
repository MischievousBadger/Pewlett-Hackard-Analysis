# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Pewlett-Hackard is a large company that is currently looking carefully at its employee base as "baby boomers" get closer to retirement.  To determine how many employees will be nearing retirement age, Human Resources has been pulling together various datasets, both to look at what positions may need filling in the future as well as to know which employees are eligible for their retirement package offerings.  Leadership is also considering adding a mentorship program for employees who are ready to retire; this would allow the experienced retirees to move into part-time roles while mentoring new staff. The purpose of the current analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are currently eligible to participate in a management mentorship program.
